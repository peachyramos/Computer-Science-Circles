#Coding Exercise: Shopping
You are going shopping for meat and milk, but there is tax. You buy $2.00 of milk and $4.00 of meat, and the tax rate is 3%. Print out the total cost of your groceries (you don't need to print the dollar sign).
meatPrice = 4.00
meatTax = 0.03 * meatPrice
milkPrice = 2.00
milkTax = 0.03 * milkPrice
print(meatTax + meatPrice + milkTax + milkPrice)
