#Coding Exercise: One Road
#For part 1, there is a single road between the two cities. The road has three bridges with weight limits a, b, c, as shown in the picture below:
#In order to drive along the route, your truck needs to drive first over the bridge with weight limit a, then the one with weight limit b, then the one with weight limit c. Your truck will crash if you overload any of the three weight limits. Write a program that prints out the maximum weight that can be transported along this road. Your code should assume that the variables a, b, and c already contain the bridge weight limits.
route1 = min(a,b,c)
print(min(a,b,c))

#Coding Exercise: Two Roads
#Part #2: Now we will tell you the whole story. There is also a second route consisting of two bridges, the first with weight limit d, and the second with weight limit e, as illustrated below.
#Your truck can take either route. Write a program that prints out the maximum weight that can be transported between the two cities. Assume that the variables a, b, c, d, and e contain the bridge weight limits.
route1 = min(a, b, c)
route2 = min(d, e)
route_best = max(route1, route2)
print(route_best)

#Scramble Exercise: Sort of Strangeness
#Arrange the code so that it prints the three numbers x, y and z sorted in increasing order, so that the smallest is printed first, then the middle one, and then the largest one.
print(min(x, y, z))
print(x + y + z -min(x, y, z) - max (x, y , z))
print ( max ( x, y, z ) )

#Coding Exercise: Growth Debugging
#Fix the logic error in this program: it should calculate the population of your country for the next 3 years, assuming it starts with 1000 people in 2012, and the number of people increases by 10% each year. You can change at most three characters.
populationIn2012 = 1000
populationIn2013 = populationIn2012 * 1.1
populationIn2014 = populationIn2013 * 1.1
populationIn2015 = populationIn2014 * 1.1

#Multiple Choice Exercise: Simplification
#What is a simplification of the following expression?
max(x - 3, min(x + 10, x + 5))
max(x-3, min( x+5 ))
max ( x - 3, x + 5)
max ( x + 5 )

#Coding Exercise: Complication
#Assume that the grader defines two variables A and B for you. Write a program which prints out the value
min(A, B)
#owever, there is a catch: your program is not allowed to use the min function. Instead, use max in a clever way to simulate min.
max = -max(-A, -B)
print(max)

#Coding Exercise: Payment Calculator
a = max(10, (.021) * balance)
b = min(a, balance)
print(b)

#Scramble Exercise: Sorting Scramble
#Code scramble: make the program sort the three numbers x, y and z into increasing order, so that x has the smallest value, y has the next smallest value, and z has the largest value.
Drag and drop with your mouse to rearrange the lines.
tmp = max ( x, y )
x = min ( x, y )
y = tmp
tmp = max( y , z )
y = min ( y, z )
z = tmp
tmp = max ( x, y )
x = min ( x, y )
y = tmp
